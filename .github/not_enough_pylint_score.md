_**Out of all the ways to write clean code, you really went and chose not to. Impressive choice!**_

## :warning: Pylint Check Failed :warning:

### Pylint Score: **{{pylint_score}}**

#### Minimum required score: **9.5**

It looks like your recent code changes did not meet the required Pylint score of **9.5**. Please review the Pylint output and make the necessary adjustments to improve code quality.

#### What you can do:
- **Review the Pylint report** to identify areas of your code that need improvement.
- **Refactor** sections that are lowering your score, focusing on issues like code complexity, formatting, or coding standards.
- Once changes are made, **push** your updates to the same pull request to trigger another check.

Remember, maintaining a high Pylint score helps ensure code readability, maintainability, and consistency across the project.

You can find our project's Pylint configuration in the [`.pylintrc`](../.pylintrc) file.
