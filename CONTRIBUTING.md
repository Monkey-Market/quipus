## Reporting Issues

If you find a bug, please follow these steps:
1. **Check** that the issue hasnâ€™t already been reported [here](https://github.com/Monkey-Market/quipus/issues).
2. **Create a new issue** if there isnâ€™t a similar report. Include:
   - Quipus and Python version.
   - Detailed description of the problem.
   - Steps to reproduce the bug.
   - Relevant error messages, logs, or screenshots.

## Suggestions and Improvements

We welcome improvements! If you have an idea to enhance Quipus:
1. **Check for an existing issue** in case someone has already suggested it.
2. If you donâ€™t find one, **create a new issue** with details about the improvement or feature.

## Code Contribution

If youâ€™d like to contribute code, please follow these steps:
1. **Fork the repository** and clone the fork to your local machine.
2. **Create a branch** using a descriptive naming convention like `fix/issue-XX` or `ft/new-feature`.
3. Add tests for your changes if necessary.
4. Ensure all existing tests pass.
5. Follow the [style standards](#code-style-standards) and [commit format](#commit-format).
6. **Submit a Pull Request** to the `main` branch.

## Code Style Standards

Our code follows **PEP 8** guidelines. We use [Pylint](https://github.com/Monkey-Market/quipus/actions/workflows/pylint.yml) to check style in CI, aiming for a **minimum score of 9.5**. Be sure to:
- Write clear, well-documented code using descriptive variable and function names.
- Use static typing in functions and classes.
- Add docstrings to classes and functions.

To contribute, please install the development dependencies specified in `pyproject.toml`.

## Commit Format

We use the following commit format to aid tracking and reviewing:
- `feat: | [FT]` for a new feature.
- `fix: | [FIX]` for a bug fix.
- `docs: | [DOC]` for documentation changes.
- `style: | [LINT]` for formatting changes (no code logic changes).
- `refactor: | [REF]` for changes that are not a new feature or bug fix.
- `test: | [TEST]` for adding or updating tests.
- `chore: | [CH]` for maintenance tasks.

Example:
```console
$ git commit -m "feat: add SFTP support to TemplateManager"
$ git commit -m "[FT] Add SFTP support to TemplateManager"
```

## Testing

Code contributions should include tests. We use **Pytest** and aim for high coverage on key modules. To run tests:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

If you add functionality, be sure to add relevant tests in the `tests/` directory. Tests also run automatically in CI when you submit a PR.

## Pull Requests

To submit a Pull Request (PR):
1. Make sure your PR targets the `main` branch.
2. Include a clear description of the PRâ€™s purpose and reference any relevant issues.
3. Ensure all tests pass and coverage is acceptable.
4. If relevant, include documentation about the change in the PR.
